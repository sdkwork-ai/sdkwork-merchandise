# Repository Guidelines

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before work in this repository. Global SDKWork
standards remain authoritative; this file narrows them for the Merchandise
capability and does not duplicate their normative bodies.

## Capability Identity

- Repository: `sdkwork-merchandise`
- Domain: `commerce`
- Capability: `merchandise`
- Database module: `merchandise`
- Database service code: `MERCHANDISE`
- Database table prefix: `commerce_`
- Runtime family: Rust/Axum with `sdkwork-web-framework`

## API And SDK Ownership

- This repository implements the Merchandise backend catalog route module at
  `/backend/v3/api/catalog/*`.
- The canonical authority is `sdkwork-shop-backend-api`; the generated family
  is `sdkwork-shop-backend-sdk`.
- The Shop assembly mounts `sdkwork-api-merchandise-assembly` in the same
  origin and generates the combined owner-only backend SDK.
- Do not create `sdkwork-merchandise-app-api`,
  `sdkwork-merchandise-backend-api`, `sdkwork-merchandise-app-sdk`, or a
  second backend SDK authority.
- `sdkwork-merchandise-web-support` owns shared HTTP DTO, response, mapping,
  and store-port support only; it does not own routes or an API surface.
- Do not hand-edit generated SDK output. Change the authored OpenAPI module or
  generator input and run the approved Shop sdkgen workflow.

## Implementation Rules

- Rust HTTP handlers use `sdkwork-web-framework` and `sdkwork-utils-rust`.
- Success bodies use `SdkWorkApiResponse` with numeric `code: 0`, `data`, and
  `traceId`; errors use `application/problem+json` `ProblemDetail`.
- Create returns `201`; delete returns `204` without a body; list responses use
  `data.items` and `data.pageInfo`.
- Shared database bootstrap uses one process pool and
  `bootstrap_merchandise_database`; do not introduce Shop-named compatibility
  aliases in Merchandise crates.
- Do not add database schema, DDL, or migration changes without explicit
  database-owner review.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.

## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

<!-- SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline); package/crate
naming and dependency declaration are normative in `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1
and 3.2.

- Crates are responsibility-shaped: service, repository-sqlx, routes, service-host, native-host,
  worker, assembly, gateway. No generic `core`/`common`/`backend`/`runtime` suffixes.
- Errors are typed enums (`thiserror`) implementing `std::error::Error` with a `source` chain.
  `anyhow` only at binary/CLI/test boundaries, never in lib `[dependencies]`.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment; crates default to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
  No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in library code reachable from public API.
- No lock guard held across `.await`; every external await has a timeout; spawned tasks are
  awaited/detached with a documented owner; retries are bounded, jittered, and idempotent.
- Public API is minimal, documented, `#[must_use]` where applicable, and semver-clean. Leaking
  framework types (`sqlx::Row`, axum extractors) through public signatures is forbidden.
- Workspace root declares `[workspace.package]` (edition, rust-version) and `[workspace.lints]`
  (RUST_CODE_SPEC.md section 13 baseline); every member inherits both with
  `edition.workspace = true` and `[lints] workspace = true`.

<!-- SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## TypeScript Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline).

- `tsconfig` runs `strict: true` and the strict family; public APIs are typed and `any`-free.
  `import type` is required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Errors are typed at package/service boundaries; no empty catches, no swallowed promise
  rejections, no bare `throw new Error('...')` for business failures.
- Async: every promise is settled; external awaits have timeouts; `AbortSignal` accepted for
  cancellable work; bounded concurrency; no unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Public API is minimal, JSDoc-documented, `@deprecated` where applicable, and semver-clean.
- Discriminated unions model closed variant sets; no `as`/`@ts-ignore` bypasses without a guard.
- Node/build runners verify build-critical sources and self-heal from git (CODE_STYLE_SPEC §7);
  `pnpm clean` never deletes git-tracked build-critical files.

## Frontend Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2); language rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (React/TS) or `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (Flutter).

- UI -> service -> injected SDK flow is preserved; components never construct SDK clients or
  assemble raw HTTP/auth headers.
- React: hooks rules clean (`react-hooks`), `useEffect` with full deps and cleanup, stable
  list keys, error boundaries at route/page level, derived state during render (not in effects).
- State: server state behind services/query layer; client state local or minimal typed store;
  no duplication of server state in client stores.
- Accessibility: accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible focus, color is never the only
  signal; error states announced.
- i18n for all user-facing copy in reusable/user-facing packages (I18N_SPEC §6.1).
- PC/H5 `outDir` uses `dist/{standalone,cloud}/{dev,test,staging,prod}`.

## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.
